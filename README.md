## Context

We are a  French familly living in Amsterdam, Netherlands  since March 2014. My
wife gave birth to our son in September 2018.

First day  without bringing our  son to  childcare. Everything feels  normal at
home for  him and I guess  he thinks we  are Saturday or Sunday.  Everything is
also good at work.

## 2020-03-12

Following the quick  spread of **COVID-19** in Netherlands, we  decided with my
wife to start the  lockdown on the `Thursday, March 12th 2020`.  By the way our
son is 1.5 year old today.
