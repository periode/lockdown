First day  without bringing our  son to  childcare. Everything looks  normal at
home for him and I guess he thinks we are Saturday or Sunday.

## 2020-03-12

Following the quick  spread of **COVID-19** in Netherlands, we  decided with my
wife to start the  lockdown on the `Thursday, March 12th 2020`.  By the way our
son is 1.5 year old today.
