## Context

We are a  French familly living in Amsterdam, Netherlands  since March 2014. My
wife gave birth to our son in September 2018.

Last but  least I  am a  smoker and  I decided  to reduce  my consumption  to 5
cigarets a day to preserve myself a bit (no comments).

## 2020-03-19 - Day 07

## 2020-03-18 - Day 06

## 2020-03-17 - Day 05

## 2020-03-16 - Day 04

First day working from home with our son at home. Let the party begin!

## 2020-03-15 - Day 03

A regular Sunday looks like a Saturday  in terms of dispatch but we usually try
to visit a place or museum. We decided again to go out two times for 30 minutes
walk. Our son start to be really sick  but indeed we still don't know if it's a
regular cold or something else. We  decided to apply some old fashion medicines
like  an  onion  in  his  bedroom,  oil  and  good  food.   My  wife  work  for
[Cocolis](https://www.cocolis.fr/) and received a late call saying that it will
be      hard      time     for      the      company      which     is      the
[BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.com/) of customer delivery.

## 2020-03-14 - Day 02

A regular  Saturday is splitted  in two: my  wife take care  of our son  in the
morning,   they   tend   to   go   out  for   2   hours   mainly   walking   in
[Beatrixpark](https://www.amsterdam.info/parks/beatrixpark/) and I take care of
him in  the afternoon,  we tend to  go out  for 2 hours  mainly walking  in [De
Pijp](https://www.amsterdam.info/depijp/).   We decided  to recude  them to  30
minutes walk in our Neiborhood. At the end  of the day our son was happy and go
to bed pretty easily. Our son is now coughing pretty hard.

## 2020-03-13 - Day 01

First day  without bringing our  son to  childcare. Everything feels  normal at
home for him  and I guess he  thinks we are Saturday or  Sunday.  Everything is
also good at work. Our son start to be a bit sick wihtout any fever.

## 2020-03-12 - Day 00

Following the quick  spread of **COVID-19** in Netherlands, we  decided with my
wife to start the  lockdown on the `Thursday, March 12th 2020`.  By the way our
son is 1.5 year old today.
